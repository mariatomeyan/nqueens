# N-Queens Solver

## Introduction

The N-Queens puzzle is a classical problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves placing `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This Python project provides a solution to the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. It is designed to be both a demonstration of algorithmic thinking and a practical implementation of backtracking techniques.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

No additional libraries are required to run this project as it uses pure Python. Simply clone this repository or download the source code to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-queens-solver.git
cd n-queens-solver
```

## Running the Code

To run the N-Queens solver, execute the `nqueens.py` file from your command line. You must specify the size of the chessboard (N). For example, to solve for a 4x4 board, you would use:

```bash
python nqueens.py 4
